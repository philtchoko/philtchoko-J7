1. 

Inside a packet contains a header and a payload. The header provides the location for where the payload(the part holding the information) can be sent.

2.

The purpose of the internet layer in the TCP/IP protocol is to send data from the user's internet network to other networks like Google for example. The client has to specify the header within the packet.

3.

The transport layer provides a mechanism in order to facilitate better communication and differentiation of different networks through the use of ports. The client also has to specify the header within the packet.

4. 

SMTP is used to transmit email messages while HTTP is used to download web content.

5.

A domain name is an identifier that contains an ip address that is used to access the data within a networked device


6. 

The operating system uses different ports in order to differentiate processes that are occuring on the same computer

 public class ColorSocket {
    public static void main(String args[]){
        
        Socket sock = null;
        try {
            sock = new Socket("123.45.678.900", 4040);
            System.out.println("Red");
        }
        catch(Exception e){
            System.err.println("Cannot Connect");
            System.exit(1);
        }

    }


 }

 8. 

 The socket's input stream involves reading data while the output streams involves sending data

 9.

 Sockets work more on the client side whereas Server Sockets accept incoming connects.



 10.

 Threads can be useful in the way that they provide a means for servers to conduct multiple processes at the same time for a client that is connecting to a web server or different type of network. A server always manages to listen to sockets trying to connect by starting a new thread in each thread.
